{"text": "br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and K\u00fchholzer et al.

Optimal decision making in Dec-POMDPs is NEXP complete, so we employ the single-agent POMDP approximation of Vogel et al. (2013).

Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al.

In addition, they initialize their approach by solving a convex relaxation of the the original problem.

During interviews, these postal workers stated that they were aware of the risks involved in their work practices, but they perceived them as more acceptable than the timewasting associated with a safer work practice. The present study found that work organisation impacted on the adoption of work practices involving greater risk. In the assembler-welder working situation, part supply problems linked to organisational deficiencies in the logistics sector obliged operators to adopt a work practice involving risk. Indeed, when available, parts could be prepared at the start of chassis assembly. Otherwise, operators had to climb more often onto, or down from, a template to collect parts (climbing down from templates being particularly unsafe). The impact of training received by operators in terms of both safety and ways of performing the required task has also been put forward by Bentley and Haslam (1998) and", "label": "background", "metadata": {}}

Because the goal of grounded theory is to generate a formal substantive theory that accounts for a main concern and pattern of behavior that is relevant to those involved (Glaser, 1978), it was a logical approach to examining what men find most challenging about responding to experiences of WPB and how they went about addressing these challenges, an area about which little is known. The focus on contextual influences that is characteristic of grounded theory allowed us to explore and understand factors that accounted for variation in how men responded to bullying such as gender. Even though our approach to grounded theory is rooted in the original strategies outlined by Glaser and Strauss (1967) and subsequent writings by Glaser (1978, 1992, 1998), we believe that knowledge gained from research is shaped by both the researcher and participants and thus is socially constructed (Charmaz, 2003).", "label": "background", "metadata": {}}
